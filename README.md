# EDA of Zomato restaurants dataset

- The *zomato_EDA* notebook contains exploratory analysis of restaurant data scraped from Zomato, a very popular restaurant aggregator and food delivery app in India. The *zomato_API_scraping* notebook contains starter code to scrape relevant data from the zomato APIs. In this way you can scrape your own data off the web and find out which restaurant suits your mood today :)

- **I have used both Seaborn and Plotly for data visualisation. Unfortunately, interactive plotly charts are not rendered in Github. Please click on [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dsanyal/Zomato_dataset_EDA/blob/master/zomato_EDA.ipynb) to go to the Jupyter nbviewer and have all the Plotly charts rendered inline.**
- Let me know if you have any comments/suggestions.
